I'm this now, a little bit different
But I guess that's what life will do
In the same town, but it's not so innocent
Growing up but it feels too soon, it feels too soon
The pressure, my head hurts
You'd think it get better, not worse
I am this now, but I'm not so innocent
And I lay here
I don't want to go to sleep alone
'Cause when I look out my window
(When I look out my window)
I'm scared it's not fireworks anymore
I'm scared it's not fireworks anymore
Outside is not the same, not like it was before
I hope I heard fireworks outside of my door
When I'm walking I get a little bit paranoid
By everyone, every noise
Let the phone ring
'Cause of some shit I'm avoiding, yeah
The pressure, my head hurts
You think it get better, not worse
I am this now, but I'm not so innocent
And I lay here
I don't want to go to sleep alone
'Cause when I look out my window
(When I look out my window)
I'm scared it's not fireworks anymore
I'm scared it's not fireworks anymore
Outside is not the same, not like it was before
I hope I heard fireworks outside of my door
Outside of my door, ooh
My door, ooh
And I lay here
I don't want to go to sleep alone
'Cause when I look out my window
(When I look out my window)
(When I look out my window)
I'm scared it's not fireworks anymore
I'm scared it's not fireworks anymore
Outside is not the same, not like it was before
I hope I heard fireworks outside of my door (My door, yeah)
